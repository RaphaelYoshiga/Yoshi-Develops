# Books recommendations
  
[**Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship Robert C. Martin**](https://amzn.to/2UqxavM) - Excellent book for giving you what it means to be a professional developer
I would recommend for you to read after you have 1-2 years of professional development, so the book can correct some bad habits developers tend to pick up, for example commenting code.

[**Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests (Beck Signature)**](https://amzn.to/3cMt1Zl) - Booking teaching the Double Loop TDD/London style of TDD. 
Great for going a level up after learning unit tests, teaching you how to write acceptance tests that tests the entire system together in comparison with Unit Tests that tests each unit individually.

[**Building microservices by Sam Newman**](https://amzn.to/3f7aYid) - Awesome book for understanding the advantages and disadvantages of microservices.
The book goes above the technical challenges and shows you how an ideal team structure needs to be for that architecture style to work effectively.

[**Agile Technical Practices Distilled: A learning journey in technical practices and principles of software design**](https://amzn.to/3hcVVFm) - A complete book for developers with TDD, DDD with code examples.
The authors of this book know well the London TDD style, so you might be able to skip the Growing Objected-Oriented software and read straight into this oe.

# Security

- [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) - Learning how to go in the offense is the best way to learn how to defend, on this website they expose you virtual machines that you need to hack your way in. You need to hack your way in just to get a login =D. 
- [Plural Sight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) - You can learn everything for IT here really, but they do have good courses on security for [example](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/hack-yourself-first)

# Performance profiling

Do you have a performance issue you need to solve? You better of getting to the root of it, with performance profiler you can see how long each line/method is taking to execute, so you can narrow down to the bottlenecks.

## C# Performance profiling

- [Ants Profiler](https://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/ants-performance-profiler/)
- [DotTrace](https://www.jetbrains.com/profiler/)
- [Visual Studio Performance profiler](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/profiling/?view=vs-2019)

## Front end Performance profiling
- [GT Metrix](https://gtmetrix.com/) - Client side performance profiling to ensure your website is providing a good user experience

# Learning Algorithms

## Training grounds

- [Coding Game]([https://www.codingame.com/](https://www.codingame.com/)) - Practice coding through gaming, solve puzzles, develop bots and compete with other engineers.
- [Leet Code]([https://leetcode.com/) - Programming challenges, simple input and outputs. What I like most of this challenges website is that it shows how your algorithm performs, so you can see how other people are doing it.
- [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) - Nice programming challenges, useful because many interview tests are through the platform.

## Good learning Resources

-  [**MIT Open Coursewear**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb) - Learn algorithms directly from MIT teachers for free, it's unbeliavable such a good quality content is shared for free.
